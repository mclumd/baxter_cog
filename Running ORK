Problem: ork setup.sh overwrites baxter functions.

1) enable the robot:
rosrun baxter_tools enable_robot.py -e

2) Make sure the camera is connected by usb

3a) Start xtion camera/kinect (baxter neck):
roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch 
3b) Start the other kinect (baxter head):
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch //config files may not be set up

4) Start the object detection pipeline
Option A) Designed for the xtion camera
rosrun object_recognition_core detection -c `rospack find object_recognition_tabletop`/conf/detection.object.ros.ork --visualize
	-This outputs objects to rostopic /recognized_object_array

Option B)With color/not exactly sure: 
rosrun object_recognition_core detection -c `rospack find object_recognition_tod`/conf/detection.ros.ork

3) Tables: To do
