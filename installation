Note: On the workstation, baxter stuff (including ork) is installed in /usr/local. This was similar to the instructions below but required a little extra chmoding and such.

1) ROS Hydro previously installed
2) Router connected to Baxter and workstation PC
3) Baxter setup - Followed instructions from http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Workstation_Setup (ignoring the full ros install step)
4) Moveit setup - Followed instructions from https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/sdk-docs/wiki/MoveIt-Tutorial
5) ORK - followed instructions from http://wg-perception.github.io/object_recognition_core/install.html#install (using the ROS instructions to download and build from source. Installed all listed pipelines)

6) Baxter using moveit was detecting a collision between its hand camera and gripper base, as well as [right/left]_hand_range and gripper_base, gripper and gripper base. Added exceptions to ignore those to baxter_ws/src/moveit_robots/baxter/baxter_moveit_config/config/baxter.srdf
