Add these lines toend of  ~/.bashrc (some may be added already):
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash

To start working with baxter:
1) Ensure that both the workstation and baxter are connected to the same
router, which is working.
2) Plug in the robot and turn it on. It takes a couple minutes.
3) Open up the terminal and do the following:
source connect_to_baxter.sh

Note: connecting to Baxter will move you to the baxter install directory
(/usr/local/baxter), and you must cd back. This is not ideal; if anyone 
wants to take some time and fix it that would be great. The issue is 
that the baxter connection file baxter.sh must be run from this 
directory and does not complete until you exit the connection. Also note
that you will be returned to your start directory when you do exit.
